;;; Commentary:

;; "Oblique Strategies (subtitled over one hundred worthwhile dilemmas)
;; is a set of published cards created by Brian Eno and Peter Schmidt
;; first published in 1975, and is now in its fifth, open ended, edition.
;; Each card contains a phrase or cryptic remark which can be used to break
;; a deadlock or dilemma situation.  Some are specific to music composition;
;; others are more general."
;;         http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oblique_Strategies
;;
;; "I do this with hesitation.  The following list is unarguably copyrighted
;; by Brian Eno himself, and will no doubt be removed from this guide entry
;; by some uninspired lawyer.  The intent of this document is not to gain
;; financially at the expense of anyone, but to spread the knowledge of this
;; little known but really keen neato cool idea."
;;        https://h2g2.com/entry/A635528
;;
;; "The purpose of this document is to provide a listing of the complete
;; contents of all three versions of the Oblique Strategies.  While my
;; interest in doing so is scholarly, readers may be interested in
;; constructing their own "meta-set" of all three editions of the decks,
;; or in looking at what is added or deleted."
